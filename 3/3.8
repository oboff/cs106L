8. In common usage, numbers are written in decimal or base 10. This means that a string of digits is
interpreted as a sum of multiples of powers of ten. For example, the number 137 is 1·100 + 3·10 +
7·1, which is the same as 1·10 2 + 3·10 1 + 7·10 0 . However, it is possible to write numbers in other
bases as well. For example, octal, or base 8, encodes numbers as sums of multiples of powers of
eight. For example, 137 in octal would be 1·8 2 + 3·8 1 + 7·8 0 = 64 + 24 + 7 = 95 in decimal. *
Similarly, binary, or base 2, uses powers of two.
When working in a particular base, we only use digits from 0 up to that base. Thus in base 10 we
use the digits zero through nine, while in base five the only digits would be 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. This
means that 57 is not a valid base-five number and 93 is not a valid octal number. When working in
bases numbered higher than ten, it is customary to use letters from the beginning of the alphabet
as digits. For example, in hexadecimal, or base 16, one counts 0, 1, 2, ..., 9, A, B, C, D, E, F, 10. This
means that 3D45E is a valid hexadecimal number, as is DEADBEEF or DEFACED.
Write a function HasHexLetters that accepts an int and returns whether or not that integer's
hexadecimal representation contains letters. (Hint: you'll need to use the hex and dec stream
manipulators in conjunction with a stringstream . Try to solve this problem without brute-forcing
it: leverage off the streams library instead of using loops.) ♦
